### Moving Strip

* A simple, yet effective, design element for brand reinforcement.

    * Includes Quick Links, Contact Info, and Social Media links.

## Dedicated Contact Page: 

* This page fulfills the essential e-commerce requirement of clear **customer communication**.
* It maintains the brand aesthetic using the same **Bootstrap 5** and custom CSS variables.

### Form Implementation

* The form is structured using Bootstrap's grid system for a clean layout.
* **Key Feature: External Submission Handling.**
    * The form action uses a third-party service: `action="https://formsubmit.co/balloilenia@gmail.com"`
    * This allows email submissions **without server-side scripting**, making the project portable and easy to deploy.
